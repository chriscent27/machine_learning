Linear Regression

Goal:
	The goal of this project is to simulate and the gradiend descent algorithm to optimise linear regression problem.

How to make it work.

Step 1:	Put the data for linear regression problem in the txt file.
		 The data has to be coma seperated values.

Step 2: Input the value of alpha in the script.
		 The self.alpha variable can be initialised to change the values of alpha.

Step 3: Run the script 'linear_regression.py' with python3. The script will show the
		 gradient descent process in a graph. The output theta values are displayed 
		 in the bottom in the terminal.


PS : The algorithm will run by default. The data given in the script will by default
	  show the output. This algorithm will only run for input data sets, ie
	  x1 + x2 = h1

Dependencies:
	Python 3.4 or greater
	matplotlib module for python.
